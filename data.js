    bio: [
      `A soul-rooted alternative R&B artist who sings, writes, and produces, London-based Jordan Rakei 
      debuted in 2013 with the EP Franklin's Room before issuing a slew of albums for Ninja Tune, 
      including 2021's deeply personal What We Call Life.`,
      `Born in Tokoroa, New Zealand and raised in Australia, Jordan Rakei grew up playing piano and guitar,
      eventually debuting in 2013 with the self-released EP Franklin's Room. A mix of reggae and classic soul
      ballads, Rakei followed the release a year later with the more R&B-focused -- and D'Angelo inspired --
      five-track Groove Curse EP. A move to London in 2015 saw him working with a host of artists, appearing on
      recordings by FKJ ("Learn to Fly"), Alfa Mist ("Hopeful") and most prominently, a contribution to
      Disclosure's Caracal ("Masterpiece"). Rakei released his debut album, Cloak, in 2016 on his own imprint,
      4101 Records, before inking a deal with Ninja Tune a year later. His sophomore album, Wallflower, his first
      for the label, appeared in 2017 and saw him taking a more eclectic approach to his own brand of alternative
      R&B. Rakei continued to collaborate, including with Loyle Carner and Nightmares on Wax, before issuing his
      third album, 2019's Origin. Following its release, he headed out on tour with dates in Europe, Australia,
      and the U.S. In 2021, Rakei put together a selection of tracks for the long-running compilation series Late
      Night Tales, while also supplying two covers -- Radiohead's "Codex" and Jeff Buckley's "Lover, You Should've
      Come Over" -- for the release. Rakei was also working on his fourth studio album, What We Call Life. The
      deeply personal release --which saw him using his own life as lyrical inspiration -- was issued in late
      2021, preceded by the track "Family."`,

    bio: [
      `London-based producer/singer/songwriter Tom Misch blends hip-hop-inspired beats with smoothly soulful vocals and guitar.`,
      `The son of an artist and a psychiatrist, Misch grew up in a home that encouraged creativity, and learned to play violin at a 
      young age via the Suzuki method. While he was still a child, his family also discovered Misch could sing when he belted out Patrick Watson's 
      "Man Like You" one day after school. After listening to rock music for most of his childhood and teens, he discovered hip-hop during his sixth 
      form years thanks to one of his sister's boyfriends, and was particularly inspired by the work of J Dilla. Misch started making his own beats 
      and took classes in music technology, and began posting tracks online in 2012. Up-and-coming rappers sampled his beats in their own work, 
      and Misch also collaborated with local singer/songwriter Carmody, ultimately releasing the Out to Sea EP with her in 2014. That year, he also 
      issued Beat Tape 1, a collection of instrumental tracks that included "Dilla Love," an homage to his idol that earned approval from Dilla's mother, 
      Maureen Yancey. "Memory," Misch's debut single on his own Beyond the Groove label, arrived that July.`,
      `The following year, Beat Tape 2 arrived, this time featuring collaborations with vocalists including Carmody, Loyle Carner, and Zak Abel. 
      On his 2016 EP Reverie, Misch blended the different aspects of his music into laid-back, R&B-tinged pop, and took the lead vocal on several tracks. 
      He returned in 2017 with the single "South of the River" and the 5-Day Mischon EP, a set of five songs recorded in five days that featured contributions 
      from Carmody, Novelist, Will Heard, Kaidi Akinnibi, and Tobie Tripp. He also collaborated with Carner on his 2017 single "Damselfly." 
      The following year, Misch delivered his debut full-length album, Geography, featuring the singles "Movie" and "Lost in Paris." What Kinda Music, 
      a collaboration with Yussef Dayes, arrived in April 2020 and included the spotlight track "Kyiv."`,

      `Yussef Dayes is one of the UK’s most exciting, innovative young drummers and producers. Though largely considered a 
      “jazz” drummer, his sound melds everything from 70s funk to Senegalese percussion to recent UK grime. The unifying factor is a fluid, vital energy.`,
      `Growing up in South East London, Yussef began his musician journey listening to his dad’s jazz records, and performing with his brothers from age 4. 
      He’s gone on to study with the legendary Billy Cobham, and began regular gigging with his brothers in afrobeat and rock-influenced jazz outfit United Vibrations. 
      He is also known for his collaboration with Kamaal Williams, creating the duet Yussef Kamaal in 2015. Following 2018’s ‘Love Is The Message’ - 
      Yussef’s first solo release - 2019 is set to be his busiest year yet, with a debut solo album in the pipeline as well as collaborative projects across the board.`,

      `As NPR writes, “siblings Clyde and Gracie Lawrence are not your typical pair." Clyde Lawrence and Gracie Lawrence have been 
      writing songs and listening to countless Stevie Wonder, Randy Newman, and Aretha Franklin records in their family's New York 
      City apartment since they were little kids. After years of playing together, they officially created Lawrence, an eight-piece 
      soul-pop band comprised of musician friends from childhood and college. The band has since gained a devoted following for its high-energy, 
      keyboard-driven sound, which features tight, energetic horns, explosive lead vocals, and fully-live arrangements.`,
      `Lawrence first rose to prominence in 2016 when they released their debut LP Breakfast (2016), which received attention and 
      praise from a variety of sources ranging from NPR's All Things Considered to Stephen Curry's social media. Produced by Grammy 
      Award winner Eric Krasno (Lettuce/Tedeschi Trucks/Soulive), Breakfast includes guest performances by NYC soul/funk mainstays 
      Adam Deitch (Lettuce), Cory Henry (Cory Henry & the Funk Apostles, Snarky Puppy), and Maurice "Mobetta" Brown (Anderson . Paak, Tedeschi Trucks Band).`,
      `Lawrence has sold out headline shows across the country and appeared at festivals including Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, Firefly, 
      Okeechobee, Hangout, and many more. The band has also opened for notable acts such as Lake Street Dive, Vulfpeck, Jon Bellion, 
      Soulive, Jacob Collier, Blues Traveler, O.A.R, Bernhoft, and others.`,
      `In addition to the band, Clyde and Gracie have also amassed considerable resumes with other artistic pursuits. 
      Clyde has written songs and score for film and television, including Disney's Noelle (2019), Steven Spielberg's 
      Animaniacs (2020), Landline (2017), The Rewrite (2015), Music and Lyrics (2007), and even Miss Congeniality (2000), 
      for which he wrote the theme song at age five. Gracie is an accomplished actress, appearing as a series regular alongside 
      John Caroll Lynch, Leslie Odom Jr., and Sturgill Simpson in the CBS All-Access murder mystery One Dollar. Gracie has also 
      appeared on Broadway in Brighton Beach Memoirs (2009), in films such as The Sitter (2011) and Did You Hear About the Morgans? 
      (2009), and in tv shows including The Good Wife (2012), The Americans (2014), and Younger (2015).`,

      `After a decade of relentless touring and recording in all but complete obscurity, the Texas-bred/New York-based 
    quasi-collective suddenly found itself held up by the press and public as one of the major figures in the jazz world. 
    “An exultant throwdown of smart danceability” (Village Voice), Snarky Puppy isn’t exactly a jazz band. 
    It’s not a fusion band, and it’s definitely not a jam band. It’s probably best to take Nate Chinen of The New York Times’ 
    advice, as stated in an online discussion about the group, to “take them for what they are, rather than judge them for what they’re not.”`,
      `The global collective which features a revolving cast of up to a dozen musicians makes what it likes to call “music for your brain and booty.” 
      Led by bassist and composer Michael League, the band's rotating lineup features musicians whose résumés boast work with stars like Erykah Badu, 
      Marcus Miller, Justin Timberlake, Roy Hargrove, Snoop Dogg and John Mayer. Their 2017 release, Culcha Vulcha, won a GRAMMY for Best Contemporary 
      Instrumental Album, and 2019 saw the release of the studio session Immigrance. 2020’s double-disc release Live at the Royal Albert Hall, 
      recorded in London during the Immigrance tour, won the band a well-deserved Best Contemporary Instrumental Album nod at the 2021 GRAMMYs.`,
