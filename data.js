    bio: [
      `A technical post-hardcore band with heavy instrumental tendencies, Chon formed in San Diego in 2008. The band originally 
    comprised bassist/vocalist Esiah Camarena, drummer Nathan Camarena, and guitarists Erick Hansel and Mario Camarena. While playing shows on 
    the emo and post-hardcore scene, Chon's tunes were influenced from the start by jazz, prog rock, and even classical tendencies. Esiah was out 
    of the band by the time they released their debut EP, Newborn Sun, in 2013, replaced by bassist Drew Pelisek. They toured frequently, returning 
    the next year with another EP, Woohoo!, and in 2015 they released their first full-length album, Grow (Sumerian Records). Pelisek left Chon near 
    the end of the year, and the group toured with three different bassists after his departure, including Esiah, who officially re-joined the band in 2016. 
    Chon's sophomore set, Homey, arrived in 2017, adding hip-hop and R&B influences to the group's sound. They quickly followed with their third set, 
    a self-titled collection that included singles "Petal" and "Peace."`,

      debuted in 2013 with the EP Franklin's Room before issuing a slew of albums for Ninja Tune, 
      including 2021's deeply personal What We Call Life.`,
      `Born in Tokoroa, New Zealand and raised in Australia, Jordan Rakei grew up playing piano and guitar,
      eventually debuting in 2013 with the self-released EP Franklin's Room. A mix of reggae and classic soul
      ballads, Rakei followed the release a year later with the more R&B-focused -- and D'Angelo inspired --
      five-track Groove Curse EP. A move to London in 2015 saw him working with a host of artists, appearing on
      recordings by FKJ ("Learn to Fly"), Alfa Mist ("Hopeful") and most prominently, a contribution to
      Disclosure's Caracal ("Masterpiece"). Rakei released his debut album, Cloak, in 2016 on his own imprint,
      4101 Records, before inking a deal with Ninja Tune a year later. His sophomore album, Wallflower, his first
      for the label, appeared in 2017 and saw him taking a more eclectic approach to his own brand of alternative
      R&B. Rakei continued to collaborate, including with Loyle Carner and Nightmares on Wax, before issuing his
      third album, 2019's Origin. Following its release, he headed out on tour with dates in Europe, Australia,
      and the U.S. In 2021, Rakei put together a selection of tracks for the long-running compilation series Late
      Night Tales, while also supplying two covers -- Radiohead's "Codex" and Jeff Buckley's "Lover, You Should've
      Come Over" -- for the release. Rakei was also working on his fourth studio album, What We Call Life. The
      deeply personal release --which saw him using his own life as lyrical inspiration -- was issued in late
      2021, preceded by the track "Family."`,

      writing songs and listening to countless Stevie Wonder, Randy Newman, and Aretha Franklin records in their family's New York 
      City apartment since they were little kids. After years of playing together, they officially created Lawrence, an eight-piece 
      soul-pop band comprised of musician friends from childhood and college. The band has since gained a devoted following for its high-energy, 
      keyboard-driven sound, which features tight, energetic horns, explosive lead vocals, and fully-live arrangements.`,
      `Lawrence first rose to prominence in 2016 when they released their debut LP Breakfast (2016), which received attention and 
      praise from a variety of sources ranging from NPR's All Things Considered to Stephen Curry's social media. Produced by Grammy 
      Award winner Eric Krasno (Lettuce/Tedeschi Trucks/Soulive), Breakfast includes guest performances by NYC soul/funk mainstays 
      Adam Deitch (Lettuce), Cory Henry (Cory Henry & the Funk Apostles, Snarky Puppy), and Maurice "Mobetta" Brown (Anderson . Paak, Tedeschi Trucks Band).`,
      `Lawrence has sold out headline shows across the country and appeared at festivals including Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, Firefly, 
      Okeechobee, Hangout, and many more. The band has also opened for notable acts such as Lake Street Dive, Vulfpeck, Jon Bellion, 
      Soulive, Jacob Collier, Blues Traveler, O.A.R, Bernhoft, and others.`,
      `In addition to the band, Clyde and Gracie have also amassed considerable resumes with other artistic pursuits. 
      Clyde has written songs and score for film and television, including Disney's Noelle (2019), Steven Spielberg's 
      Animaniacs (2020), Landline (2017), The Rewrite (2015), Music and Lyrics (2007), and even Miss Congeniality (2000),

      John Caroll Lynch, Leslie Odom Jr., and Sturgill Simpson in the CBS All-Access murder mystery One Dollar. Gracie has also 
      appeared on Broadway in Brighton Beach Memoirs (2009), in films such as The Sitter (2011) and Did You Hear About the Morgans?

    what became their debut album Be Free, which would be released the following year.`,
      `The debut album was well received by critics, garnering praise from many musical greats including Jill Scott, DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Stevie Wonder. After

      `Since the release of Be Free in 2012, the band has released three more albums through British record label Tru Thoughts and toured internationally.

    “An exultant throwdown of smart danceability” (Village Voice), Snarky Puppy isn’t exactly a jazz band. 
    It’s not a fusion band, and it’s definitely not a jam band. It’s probably best to take Nate Chinen of The New York Times’ 
    advice, as stated in an online discussion about the group, to “take them for what they are, rather than judge them for what they’re not.”`,
      `The global collective which features a revolving cast of up to a dozen musicians makes what it likes to call “music for your brain and booty.”

      Marcus Miller, Justin Timberlake, Roy Hargrove, Snoop Dogg and John Mayer. Their 2017 release, Culcha Vulcha, won a GRAMMY for Best Contemporary 
      Instrumental Album, and 2019 saw the release of the studio session Immigrance. 2020’s double-disc release Live at the Royal Albert Hall,

      `The son of an artist and a psychiatrist, Misch grew up in a home that encouraged creativity, and learned to play violin at a 
      young age via the Suzuki method. While he was still a child, his family also discovered Misch could sing when he belted out Patrick Watson's 
      "Man Like You" one day after school. After listening to rock music for most of his childhood and teens, he discovered hip-hop during his sixth 
      form years thanks to one of his sister's boyfriends, and was particularly inspired by the work of J Dilla. Misch started making his own beats 
      and took classes in music technology, and began posting tracks online in 2012. Up-and-coming rappers sampled his beats in their own work, 
      and Misch also collaborated with local singer/songwriter Carmody, ultimately releasing the Out to Sea EP with her in 2014. That year, he also 
      issued Beat Tape 1, a collection of instrumental tracks that included "Dilla Love," an homage to his idol that earned approval from Dilla's mother, 
      Maureen Yancey. "Memory," Misch's debut single on his own Beyond the Groove label, arrived that July.`,
      `The following year, Beat Tape 2 arrived, this time featuring collaborations with vocalists including Carmody, Loyle Carner, and Zak Abel. 
      On his 2016 EP Reverie, Misch blended the different aspects of his music into laid-back, R&B-tinged pop, and took the lead vocal on several tracks. 
      He returned in 2017 with the single "South of the River" and the 5-Day Mischon EP, a set of five songs recorded in five days that featured contributions 
      from Carmody, Novelist, Will Heard, Kaidi Akinnibi, and Tobie Tripp. He also collaborated with Carner on his 2017 single "Damselfly." 
      The following year, Misch delivered his debut full-length album, Geography, featuring the singles "Movie" and "Lost in Paris." What Kinda Music, 
      a collaboration with Yussef Dayes, arrived in April 2020 and included the spotlight track "Kyiv."`,

    discovered songwriting after listening to writers like John Mayer and Gavin DeGraw and decided she wanted to be a singer-songwriter when she grew up. She participated 
    in local and school competitions wherever she could and started booking her own gigs. Her reputation at school was "that singer girl who spends all her time
